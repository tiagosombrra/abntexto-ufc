# Repository maintenance roadmap

This document is the current durable map for repository-wide maintenance and organization work. The authoritative tracking issue is #359.

It does not redefine release state. Publication and development-line facts remain owned by `release/v3-release-candidate.json` and `docs/RELEASE-STATE.md`.

## Invariants

- Published v3.0.4 source, annotated tag, GitHub Release assets and checksums remain immutable.
- CTAN follow-up remains tracked by issue #356 until external acceptance/publication is confirmed.
- `abntexto-ufc.cls` remains the canonical project-owned runtime at repository root.
- Historical evidence under `docs/history/v3/` and `release/history/v3/` is not reorganized retroactively merely for aesthetics.
- Every material phase uses a bounded branch/PR, records checks and carries unresolved findings forward.
- Structural changes must reduce path coupling before moving large groups of files.

## Phase map

| Phase | Scope | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | v3.0.4 CTAN external closeout | waiting for external CTAN acceptance under #356 |
| 1 | metadata consistency and anti-drift | complete — PR #360 merged as `496f893627b1d2211161b8408e44026a2b66b157` |
| 2 | recursive discovery and path-decoupling preparation | in progress — `maintenance/path-discovery-preparation` |
| 3 | `standards/` taxonomy | pending |
| 4 | `tests/` taxonomy | pending |
| 5 | supporting repository structure (`release/`, CTAN example, tools, examples) | pending |
| 6 | self-contained Web/Lite hardening | pending |
| 7 | Windows-first portability smoke coverage | pending |
| 8 | provenance, LPPL/asset metadata and archival integration | pending |
| 9 | tagged-PDF/PDF-UA experiment | pending |
| 10 | next release certification and publication | pending |

## Phase 1 receipt

Phase 1 is complete. PR #360 merged as `496f893627b1d2211161b8408e44026a2b66b157` after Static Contract #685 and Linux Integration #592 passed. Linux Release Check was not applicable by scope because the phase did not change runtime, distribution, the release marker or published bytes. The durable receipt is also recorded in issue #359.

## Phase 1 acceptance criteria

Phase 1 implementation is carried by PR #360. It is complete only when:

1. `CITATION.cff` identifies published v3.0.4 and its publication date;
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` no longer duplicates volatile current release/development-line values;
3. `docs/RELEASE-STATE.md` records issue #353 as completed and closed;
4. Static Contract executes an explicit metadata-consistency check;
5. the phase PR passes all required repository checks;
6. issue #359 receives the merge/check receipt.

## Phase 2 current design

Phase 2 prepares structural moves without moving taxonomy yet.

The repository now uses two fail-closed resolution surfaces:

- `tests/path_resolver.py` resolves check/integration entrypoints recursively by unique filename identity;
- `tools/repository_paths.py` resolves machine-readable normative authorities recursively under `standards/`.

Ambiguous identities are errors. `tests/checks/path_resolution_contract.py` enforces basename uniqueness, recursive discovery and the absence of flat-path reintroduction in the core runners/loaders.

The Linux suite selector normalizes nested check, integration and document paths to stable test identities before scope classification. This allows later taxonomy changes such as `tests/integration/profiles/article/scientific-article-profile.sh` without silently changing the selected regression suite.

### Phase 2 acceptance criteria

Phase 2 is complete only when:

1. Static checks resolve recursively and retain an auditable resolved `SOURCE_CHECKS` surface;
2. integration runner commands resolve recursively by unique identity;
3. Linux suite inference preserves the same suite for nested test paths;
4. normative catalog/atomic/full loaders no longer require the relevant JSON files to remain directly under `standards/`;
5. an explicit path-resolution contract fails on missing or ambiguous identities;
6. Static and Linux Integration regressions pass;
7. issue #359 receives the merge/check receipt.

## Next-phase gate

Phase 3 may move `standards/` only after Phase 2 is merged and reconciled on current `main`. Direct-path consumers discovered during the Phase 2 audit must either adopt the canonical standards resolver or be migrated atomically with the file they own; no compatibility duplicate of a normative JSON authority may be introduced.
